We have two urns, ***A*** and ***B***, with Urn ***A*** containing 2 <font color='blue'>blue</font> balls and 1 <font color='red'>red</font> ball, and Urn ***B*** containing 1 <font color='blue'>blue</font> ball and 2 <font color='red'>red</font> balls. 

The following experiment is conducted to a group of people.

We randomly select a urn, and let participants guess which urn (***A*** or ***B***) it is without seeing inside the urn.

***Scenario I***:
One by one, each participant draw a ball from the urn, check the color without showing to other participants, guess which urn it is, and put the ball back to the urn.

***Scenario II***:
One by one, each participant draw a ball from the urn, check the color, but this time show it to other participants, guess which urn it is, and put the ball back to the urn.

So, the question to answer are:
 
***Which scenario leads to more accurate individual predictions?***

***Which scenario leads to more accurate combined predictions?***
