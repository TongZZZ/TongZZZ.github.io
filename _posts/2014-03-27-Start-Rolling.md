After 3 days of head scraching, I think it is time to roll the ball. I am 100% centern that after 3 months, I would be switching to [twitter bootstrap(x.x)](http://getbootstrap.com/2.3.2/), so why don't I bother worrying how to add a side bar or how to fix the head bar. After all, the most important thing for a blog is the content, without it, layouts are just pictures.

So, get it rolling!
