After 3 days of head scratching, I think it is time to roll the ball. I am 100% certain that after 3 months, I would be switching to [twitter bootstrap(x.x)](http://getbootstrap.com/2.3.2/), so why don't I bother worrying about how to add a side bar or how to fix the head bar. After all, the most important thing for a blog is the content, without it, layouts are nothing special.

So, get it rolling!

Most static blog users are programmers, because of the steep learning curve. However, I think githup pages + Jekyll + Bootstrap is going to change this.
My javascript experience is very limited, but I was able to set up this blog in 3 days. And I can later focus on the content I have in my mind to put on.
