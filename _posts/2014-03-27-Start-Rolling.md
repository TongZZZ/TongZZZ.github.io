After 3 days of head scratching, I think it is time to roll the ball. I am 100% certain that after 3 months, I would be switching to [twitter bootstrap(x.x)](http://getbootstrap.com/2.3.2/), so why don't I bother worrying about how to add a side bar or how to fix the head bar. After all, the most important thing for a blog is the content, without it, layouts are nothing special.

So, get it rolling!

Most static blog users are programmers, because of the steep learning curve. However, I think [github pages](http://pages.github.com/) + [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) + [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/2.3.2/) is going to change this.
My javascript experience is very limited, but I was able to set up this blog in 3 days and focus on the content to put on.
This is truly amazing, and I think this will change the landscape of the static blog users, as more and more people from different background are going to switch their blog to Jekyll.
 
But also, the disadvantage is there. The technique difficulty is minimum compare to the copyright issues. Especially, in places where copyright laws are often ignored, it is just so easy to copy the entire blog and broadcast somewhere else. I think that is going to keep a lot of people away from using github pages. Anyway, this is still the best option for me. Being a data person requires me to write lots of snippets of code, and this will be a great place to record some of them. And since $$\LaTeX$$ can be relative conveniently used in markdown, I will certainly add more Math stuff.
