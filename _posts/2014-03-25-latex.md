I would like to try some of the simple latex format in markdown, I came to know there are some limitations, but let's see.
let us try some $$\LaTeX$$, see what happens $$a^2 + b^2 = c^2$$ 

and 

$$ \frac{d}{dx}\left( \int_{0}^{x} f(u)\,du\right)=f(x)$$
<!--more-->

$$ 
\begin{aligned} \dot{x} &= \sigma(y-x) \\ 
\dot{y} &= \rho x - y - xz \\ 
\dot{z} &= -\beta z + xy \end{aligned} 
$$

$$
\begin{tabular}{lrc}
Row 1, Cell 1 & Row 1, Cell 2 & Row 1, Cell 3 \\
Row 2, Cell 1 & Row 2, Cell 2 & Row 2, Cell 3 \\
\end{tabular}
$$
Looks like tables are not working well :(
