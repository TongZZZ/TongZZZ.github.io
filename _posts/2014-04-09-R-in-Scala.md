You haven't got [Spark MLib](http://spark.apache.org/mllib/) set up and you happen to need to run a quick logistic regression in scala, then you should go to [ScalaNLP](http://www.scalanlp.org/) for [Breeze](https://github.com/scalanlp/breeze) and [Nak](https://github.com/scalanlp/nak). But if you just need to run a really quick one and you happen to have R installed.

<!--more-->

This is what you can do thanks to the [jvmr package](http://dahl.byu.edu/software/jvmr/), a wrapup of the [rJava package](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rJava/index.html):

{% highlight scala %}  
import org.ddahl.jvmr.RInScala
import breeze.linalg._
import breeze.stats.distributions._
import scala.util._

val R = RInScala()

val gau = Gaussian(0.0,1.0)
val x = new DenseMatrix(10,2,gau.sample(20).toArray)         /**Generate two X predictors in Scala*/
val y = Seq.fill(10)(Random.nextFloat).map(_<0.5).toVector        /**Generate vector Y in Scala*/
R.y  = y map {case true => 1 case _ => 0}   /**Send Y to R, has to be as integer rather than t/f*/
R.x1 = x(::,1).toArray /**Send X as Vector to R, denseMatrix from breeze lib not supported in jvmr*/
R.x2 = x(::,0).toArray /**same as above*/

R> ""res = glm(y~x1+x2, family=binomial(link=probit))$coefficients""  /**Logistic regressin in R*/
R> ""plot(glm(y~x1+x2, family=binomial(link=probit))$residuals)""   /**Plot the residue in R*/

val res = R.res	 /**Get the coefficients back to Scala*/

{% endhighlight %}
